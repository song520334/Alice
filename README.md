     《Merciful sailing》        
Gonc with wind, strongyouheartGone with sun, like a songFor the goal, the years roll onHold you breath and stay alonc
The light of life is set fireNever forget why we startedSee today, we are the worldwe'll make a brighter day ![image](https://github.com/song520334/Alice/assets/141810711/c97d07bf-3391-413a-97fb-fbdb84b79d87)
